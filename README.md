## Welcome to Dislike!

This is the official repo of the project for Regional Hackaton Chile 2017

### What is Dislike?
Our main objective is to be able to represent the community's anger on certain issues.
How does it work?
### We let people add their own themes that are disgusting their own community and we show it visually within a map through circles.

The bigger the circle, the more votes this has.

### How do we achieve the representativeness of the issues that really bother people?
This is achieved through a sentimental analysis of what people are talking about on Twitter about this topic. So if anyone is bothered by Barcelona Football Team, our system will weigh the votes with a lower weight so its representativeness is not so great.
